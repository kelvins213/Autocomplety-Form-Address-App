  # Autocomplete Form Adress With Flutter

Hey, guys! Thanks for reading.

## Context
I'm currently developing an app with my team, which will be usefull for studying stuff, like reviewing or learning a new subject. That said, in the past few days, we were dealing mainly with the backend on ```flutter```. So, I was given the task to connect ```APIs``` in a form which will register the student adress, like state, city and postcode (CEP; CEDEX; zip-code). My idea was to use an api which could provide all the information I needed based on the student's postcode - so the form would automatically fullfill his camps for the user - and another API to store the data inputted on the form ny his conclusion.
